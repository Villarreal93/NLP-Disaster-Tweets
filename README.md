# NLP Disaster Tweets
A LSTM is used to predict whether the tweets of the test data are disasters or not. In the column "Target", a value of 1 denotes a disaster while a 0 denotes the contrary. The data is preprocessed with tools like NLTK and trained/padded using tensorflow. 

# Reference
I saw this idea on Python's Engineer Youtube channel, and I'm only using it to learn. If interested, go watch his full video (& channel!) on how to do this project: https://youtu.be/kxeyoyrf2cM

The data is available on Kaggle, where you can also join the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview
